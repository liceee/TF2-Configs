## Installation
1. [Download the zip folder](https://github.com/Samcfuchs/TF2-Configs/archive/master.zip)
2. Unpack however you prefer. I believe Windows has a built in tool.
3. Move *all* of the .cfg files to your config folder (see below)
4. ????
5. profit

I recommend using a hud as well as my scripts. I go between ToonHUD and RaysHUD,
but I'm particular to Rays. I also like using transparent viewmodels, which is
currently integrated into ToonHUD but not Rays, unfortunately. Soon to come is
a crosshair switcher, I think. I'll look into it. I don't want to commit to any
one hud, so I'll try to keep it nonpartisan.
